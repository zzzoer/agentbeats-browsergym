This repository contains our team’s BrowserGym Green Agent for evaluating web-based tasks on the AgentBeats platform. It supports three official BrowserGym benchmarks: MiniWoB, WebLINX, and AssistantBench.

All benchmarks are integrated into a single Green Agent that can:

Initialize and manage BrowserGym environments

Evaluate task requests from AgentBeats

Validate white-agent actions against task requirements

Return success/failure results and final scores

This unified evaluator provides a consistent assessment pipeline across all three benchmarks and supports both local demonstration and remote deployment on AgentBeats. It is submitted as our team’s entry for the AgentBeats Green Agent Challenge.
